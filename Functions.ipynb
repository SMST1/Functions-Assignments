        " An iterable is any object that can return an iterator, i.e., an object that can be looped over (e.g., with a for loop).\n",
        " To be an iterable, an object must implement the __iter__() method, which should return an iterator (another object that knows how to fetch the next element in the collection).\n",

        "           for item in my_list:  # `my_list` is an iterable\n",
        "              print(item)\n",
        "An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It allows us to iterate (loop) through the elements one by one.\n",
        "To be an iterator, an object must implement two methods:\n",
        "__iter__(): This method returns the iterator itself (which is usually the object itself).\n",
        "__next__(): This method returns the next item in the sequence and raises a StopIteration exception when there are no more items to return.\n",
        "           my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "           iterator = iter(my_list)  # Converts my_list into an iterator\n",

        "           print(next(iterator))  # Output: 2\n",

        "\n",
        "-  In Python, generators are a special type of iterable that allow to create sequences of values lazily (i.e., one at a time), which can be more memory-efficient compared to using lists, especially for large datasets or infinite sequences. Generators are defined using either generator functions or generator expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "A generator function is defined using the def keyword, just like a regular function, but it uses the yield keyword instead of return. Each time the function is called, it returns a generator object, which can be iterated over to retrieve values.\n",

        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "-  Using generators over regular functions offers several advantages, particularly when working with large datasets, complex computations, or infinite sequences. Here's a breakdown of the key benefits of using generators in Python:\n",

        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "-  A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function that is defined using the lambda keyword rather than the usual def keyword. Lambda functions are often used when a short, throwaway function is needed for a brief period of time and don’t need to be reused.\n",

        "-  The map() function in Python is a built-in function used to apply a given function to all items in an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) and return an iterator that yields the results of applying that function. It is a useful tool for transforming or processing each item of a collection without needing to explicitly write a loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Common Use Cases:\n",

        "   Transforming a List: We can apply a function to each item in a list, such as squaring each number, converting strings to uppercase, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Combining Multiple Lists: We can combine two or more iterables, such as summing the corresponding elements from two lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Data Processing: We can apply data transformation or filtering operations in a more functional style.\n",

        "-  In Python, the functions map(), reduce(), and filter() are all used for functional programming tasks and are often used to process iterables (like lists or tuples) in a concise way. However, they differ in terms of their purpose and how they process the input data.\n",
